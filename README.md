# My Portfolio Website

I'm building it step-by-step, slowly rolling out releases to make sure I don't either procrastinate or scrap requirements late in development. I want to make sure it's up somewhere doing something, no matter if it's not featureful.

TODOs / Roadmap:
- [x] Sleep hours + Icon
- [x] i18n
- [ ] Info Tooltips
- [ ] Dark / Light Mode
- [ ] My top skills
- [ ] My top projects
- [ ] A music player ???
- [ ] UI Themes ?!?! (With light/dark mode each)
- [ ] Debug Mode
