# My Portfolio Website

I'm building it step-by-step, slowly rolling out releases to make sure I don't either procrastinate or scrap requirements late in development. I want to make sure it's up somewhere doing something, no matter if it's not featureful.

TODOs / Roadmap:
- [ ] My top skills
- [ ] My top projects
